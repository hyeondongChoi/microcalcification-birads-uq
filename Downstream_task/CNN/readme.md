# Usage
## Training



We use ImageNet normalization (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) for both the ImageNet-pretrained and scratch training regimes for consistency. In supplementary experiments, we also evaluate dataset-specific normalization and observe no performance benefits over ImageNet normalization; therefore, we report ImageNet-normalized results as our main setting.
